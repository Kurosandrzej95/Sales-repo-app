# Sales-repo-app
Connecting sales repo with an HQ ERP.
Basically the future goal of this is to create an app that will make it possible to connect through api fo the local ERP software in company and will allow salesman to instantly check price, avialability of the item and place an order on the go using smartphone.
I will be working on this app while gaining more knowledge and showing through my journey in coding. 

Best of luck for me :)
